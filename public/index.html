        There is a reason this got sent to you.

        Here we go again, lets take a look at a fun interaction between two people. Our beloved, humanbeing32 is back and otherhumanbeing47 is here too!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Humanbeing32 [admin]: Hey otherhumanbeing47, do you mind if you could keep this basket weaving discussion in a thread? I made one for you and forwarded all the messages there so you can just pick up where you left off.
        I know this is the basket-weaving-main channel but Id rather keep these types of branch off discussions in a thread for 2 reasons. <br>
        1. If I need to use basket-weaving-main its not flooded. <br>
        2. You can reference this thread if you ever have a discussion like it again. <br>
        That way we can keep things organized! 

      </span>
      <p class="message"></p>
    </blockquote>   
    <p>
        humanbeing32 Is in the right here as all they want is to just not flood a chat with messages.  
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">otherhumanbeing47 [member]: <br> Actually, I don't think your reasoning holds up. You've introduced two fallacies into your argument: <br>
        1. Slippery slope - You're assuming that allowing a single side discussion here will lead to the channel being flooded, which isn't necessarily true. A single conversation doesn't automatically lead to chaos. <br>
        2. Appeal to convenience - Just because threads are sometimes more organized doesn't mean they're always the best solution. For example, in a real-time discussion like this, forcing it into a thread might actually disrupt the flow of the conversation. <br>
        Your reasoning oversimplifies the situation. What if someone prefers real-time engagement in the main channel because they find it easier to follow, or because others in the main channel might want to chime in spontaneously?

        otherhumanbeing47 is trying to be the lawyer here oh no...
    <p>
        Well... Let's break this down a bit. First, we can see that humanbeing32 is an admin so they have authority, second we can see that they also are kindly asking otherhumanbeing47 to keep the discussion in a thread. Which is totally ok and has no issues. <br>
        otherhumanbeing47 is just a plain member so they dont't have any authority here... They also seem to be trying to use some logical fallacies to try and convince humanbeing32 that they are wrong. <br>
        Lets see how this keeps going:
    </p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">humanbeing32 [admin]: <br> otherhumanbeing47, I don't think youre understanding what I'm saying...<br>
            This conversation is not going anywhere anymore because you're trying to logic your way out of it.. I won't be continuing this any more.
      </span>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">otherhumanbeing47 [member]:</span><br>
        <p>
            The kids at my day camp do this too, they put their fingers in their ears and go "blahhh blahhh I can't hear you! I'm right you're wrong, I can't hear you!"<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>
        What in the world was that? As you can see our friend, humanbeing32 realized that there was no reasoning with otherhumanbeing47 and decided to just end the conversation. (which is totally fine!) <br>
        However, otherhumanbeing47 is now trying to be disruptive throw an insult as a last resort at humanbeing32.<br>
        As you can see, any type or form of discussion with somebody who is like otherhumanbeing47 is going to be an absolute mess. Who wants to start a discussion and then be told they cant say that because its a fallacy?
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        Let's take a look at an example of how this should've gone down:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">humanbeing32 [admin]:</span>
        <p class="message">
            &lt;asks to move to thread&gt;
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">otherhumanbeing47 [member]:</span>
        <p class="message">
            Hmmm alright, I'll move this to a thread. Can I still use the main basket weaving channel for other discussions?
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">humanbeing32 [admin]:</span>
        <p class="message">
            Absolutely! I only asked you to move this to a thread because I was planning on using the main channel for another discussion and something like this looked like it was going to take a while.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    

    <p>
        Look at that discussion between 2 mature human beings! otherhumanbeing47 is now able to just accept that you shouldnt throw all the logical fallacies at humanbeing32 as it just wont get anywhere.<br>
        I'm so excited to see what otherhumanbeing47 will do with this knowledge! Imagine the places they will go!
    </p>
    <p>
        So, to summarize:<br>
        If someone says something with a fallacy in it:
        <em>"I want a new macbook pro because all my friends have one"</em>,
        Instead of instantly trying to say <em>"OH MY GOSH THATS A BANDWAGON FALLACY HOW DARE YOU"</em> Maybe try: <br>
        <em>"Oh nice! My friend has one of those and really likes it. Why do you want a new one?"</em>

        If this got sent to you then you are in the boat of "trying to be the lawyer" and I really hope you learn how to improve your communication skills. This is kinda (but not really) a joke.
